.env file cannot be uploaded because it is "hidden" so copy one from a demo project and change the values so they look like this:

APP_NAME=Uni-Threads
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY=base64:uyzDaV1SE9uipua/m190TC+J0+k21Kw8nnjBxay4W/8=
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_LOG_LEVEL=debug
APP_URL=http://localhost

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=uni
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

BROADCAST_DRIVER=log
CACHE_DRIVER=file
SESSION_DRIVER=file
QUEUE_DRIVER=sync

REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PASSWORD=null
REDIS_PORT=6379

MAIL_DRIVER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=null
MAIL_PASSWORD=null
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null

PUSHER_APP_ID=
PUSHER_APP_KEY=
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=

After this, you must copy a vendor folder aswell from a demo project and paste it into the uni folder which you will drop into you htdocs.
Vendor was too large to upload so you must get it yourself (contact me and I will get you copies of the files you need in a zip)
